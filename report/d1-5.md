------------------------

D1-5 is focusing on:

1. Built a Web demo for Joint Bi-LSTM

-------------------------


After training, the joint model is deployed to web using Flask. The web app allows user to input a Simplified Chinese sentence, then displays the segmented result with POS tags.

Setup:

  1. Make sure Python 3 is installed. Download this repo, then go inside demo folder.

  1. Install packages and start server

      ```
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      flask run
      ```

  1. Go to [localhost:5000](localhost:5000)
