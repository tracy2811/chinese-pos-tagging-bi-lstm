## Proposal

Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is a pre-requisite task to simplify many different NLP problems such as text to speech conversion and word sense disambiguation. Because one word can have a different tag in different contexts ad some parts of speed are complex and unspoken, this task is much more complicated than simply mapping words to their part of speech tags.

For Chinese, POS tagging is even more challenging (and fascinating) since Chinese word is not demarcated (for example, not space-separated like English) and the word segmentation (WS) task is vitally important.

This project aims for performing this intriguing task for simplified Chinese using bi-LSTM attention network where the WS task is done:

- at the same time as the POS tagging task
- before the POS tagging task (using different libraries such as [Jieba](https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba) and [kcws](https://github.com/koth/kcws))

F1 score will be used to evaluate the result.

## Dataset

While there are many datasets available (free and non-free), this project use [UD_Chinese-GSDSimp](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Chinese-GSDSimp/tree/master) dataset from [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org) which is free, consistent. It contains 4997 sentences and uses 15 UPOS tags out of 17 possible: ADJ, ADP, ADV, AUX, CCONJ, DET, NOUN, NUM, PART, PRON, PROPN, PUNCT, SYM, VERB, X.
